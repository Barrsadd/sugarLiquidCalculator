# Sugar Liquid Calculator

Inspired by my experience as a barista at Noren Coffee and Roastery, this calculator addresses the challenge of accurately calculating water and sugar quantities for liquid sugar solutions.  It employs a specified ratio (e.g., 5:4) to determine the precise measurements, ensuring consistency and efficiency in beverage preparation. This tool is designed to assist baristas in maintaining quality and streamlining their workflow.
